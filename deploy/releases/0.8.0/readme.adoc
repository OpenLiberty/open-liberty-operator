== Changelog

All notable changes are documented in the link:++https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#080++[Changelog].

== Supported Environments

The Open Liberty Operator is tested and built on the following CPU architectures:

* amd64

The operator will run on any cluster that has Kubernetes v1.19 or higher.

== Installation

=== Option 1: Install using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Create the `CatalogSource` to add Open Liberty Operator.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
   name: open-liberty-operator-catalog
   namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
   displayName: Open Liberty Operator
   sourceType: grpc
   image: openliberty/operator:catalog-0.8.0
----

* From the integrated OperatorHub, filter by selecting `Open Liberty Operator` checkbox under `Source`. Click on the tile with `Open Liberty` to install the operator.

=== Option 2: Install using kustomize

See the instructions link:++kustomize/++[here].

=== Option 3: Install using kubectl

See the instructions link:++kubectl/++[here]

== Current Limitations

* Knative support is limited. Values specified for `.spec.autoscaling`, `.spec.resources` and `.spec.replicas` fields would not apply for Knative when enabled using `.spec.createKnativeService` field.
* Monitoring feature does not support integration with Knative Service. Prometheus Operator is required to use ServiceMonitor.
* After the initial deployment of `OpenLibertyApplication`, any changes to its labels would be applied only when one of the fields from `.spec` is updated.
