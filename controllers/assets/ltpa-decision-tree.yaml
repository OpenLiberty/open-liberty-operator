# This file supports multi LTPA key generation across operator versions.
# Adding a new .tree.<version> is only required when LTPA generation logic has changed.
#
# Each "valid path" represents an LTPA key.
# - a "valid path" can be defined as a string that:
#     - starts with an operand version string "va.b.c"
#     - traverses each map/list element by using a period '.'
#     - terminates at a constant boolean, string
#
# In 1.3.2 (1 LTPA key per namespace), there is one possible path "v1_3_2.true" 
# In 1.4.0 (2 LTPA keys per namespace), there are two possible paths "v1_4_0.managePasswordEncryption.true" and "v1_4_0.managePasswordEncryption.false"
#
# The operator will aim to use the latest decision tree version less than or equal to the operator version. 
# - with operator version 1.6.0, the operator will use .tree.v1_4_0 which is the most up-to-date version
# - with operator version 1.4.0, the operator will use .tree.v1_4_0
# - with operator version 1.4.0-alpha, the operator will use .tree.v1_4_0 and ignores the build tags
# - with operator version 1.3.3, the operator will error saying it could not find any version.
#
# This data structure is used in ltpa_keys_sharing.go with reconcileLTPAMetadata() which builds a decision path based on the app instance.

tree:
## v1_3_2: true

    managePasswordEncryption:
      - true
      - false

## An example of how .replace.* is used:
## In 1.3.2, the singleton LTPA Secret did not have password encryption, so the key represented by path "v1_3_2.true" is the same key as represented by path "v1_4_0.managePasswordEncryption.false"
## The 1.3.2 operator will create an LTPA Secret and label it "v1_3_2.0" which indicates the path at index 0 for .tree.v1_3_2.
## The 1.4.0 operator will search LTPA Secrets within the namespace and sees that the "v1_3_2" LTPA Secret could potentially be updated.
##     It then reads key-values in .replace.v1_4_0 which shows that there is an upgrade path from v1_3_2.true to v1_4_0.managePasswordEncryption.false
##     The operator will save this new metadata and patch the LTPA Secret's label by updating to "v1_4_0.1" which represents path index 1 for .tree.v1_4_0.
## Similarly, when the 1.3.2 operator is re-run on the v1_4_0 LTPA Secret, a downgrade will also occur and the LTPA Secret will be patched once again.
