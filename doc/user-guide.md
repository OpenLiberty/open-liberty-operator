# Open Liberty Operator

The Open Liberty Operator can be used to deploy and manage applications running on Open Liberty into [OKD](https://www.okd.io/) or [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters. You can also perform [Day-2 operations](#day-2-operations) such as gathering traces and dumps using the operator.

This documentation refers to the current master branch.  For documentation and samples of older releases, please check out the [main releases](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/releases) page and navigate the corresponding tag.

## Operator installation

Use the instructions for one of the [releases](../deploy/releases) to install the operator into a Kubernetes cluster.

The Open Liberty Operator can be installed to:

- watch own namespace
- watch another namespace
- watch multiple namespaces
- watch all namespaces in the cluster

Appropriate cluster roles and bindings are required to watch another namespace, watch multiple namespaces or watch all namespaces in the cluster.

## Overview

The architecture of the Open Liberty Operator follows the basic controller pattern:  the Operator container with the controller is deployed into a Pod and listens for incoming resources with `Kind: OpenLibertyApplication`. Creating an `OpenLibertyApplication` custom resource (CR) triggers the Open Liberty Operator to create, update or delete Kubernetes resources needed by the application to run on your cluster.

In addition, Open Liberty Operator makes it easy to perform [Day-2 operations](#day-2-operations) on an Open Liberty server running inside a Pod as part of an `OpenLibertyApplication` instance:
- Gather server traces using resource `Kind: OpenLibertyTrace`
- Generate server dumps using resource `Kind: OpenLibertyDump`

## Configuration

### Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

Each instance of `OpenLibertyApplication` CR represents the application to be deployed on the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 9080
  expose: true
  storage:
    size: 2Gi
    mountPath: "/logs"
```

The following table lists configurable parameters of the `OpenLibertyApplication` CRD. For complete OpenAPI v3 representation of these values please see [`OpenLibertyApplication` CRD](../deploy/crds/openliberty.io_openlibertyapplications_crd.yaml).

Each `OpenLibertyApplication` CR must specify `applicationImage` parameter. Specifying other parameters is optional.

### Basic usage

Use official [Open Liberty images and guidelines](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#container-images) to create your application image.

Use the following CR to deploy your application image to a Kubernetes environment:

 ```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
```

The `applicationImage` value must be defined in `OpenLibertyApplication` CR. On OpenShift, the operator tries to find an image stream name with the `applicationImage` value. The operator falls back to the registry lookup if it is not able to find any image stream that matches the value. If you want to distinguish an image stream called `my-company/my-app` (project: `my-company`, image stream name: `my-app`) from the Docker Hub `my-company/my-app` image, you can use the full image reference as `docker.io/my-company/my-app`.

To get information on the deployed CR, use either of the following:

```sh
oc get olapp my-liberty-app
oc get olapps my-liberty-app
oc get openlibertyapplication my-liberty-app
```

### Common Component Documentation

Open Liberty Operator is based on the generic [Runtime Component
Operator](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator). To see more
information on the usage of common functionality, see the Runtime Component Operator documentation below. Note that, in the samples from the links below, the instances of `Kind:
RuntimeComponent` must be replaced with `Kind: OpenLibertyApplication`.

For functionality that is unique to the Open Liberty Operator, see the following sections.

### Open Liberty Environment Variables

The Open Liberty Operator sets a number of environment variables related to console logging by default. The following table shows the variables and their corresponding values.

| Name                           | Value                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL` | info                         |
| `WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_SOURCE`   | message,accessLog,ffdc,audit |
| `WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT`   | json                         |

To override these default values with your own values, set them manually in your CR `env` list.

```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  env:
    - name: WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT
      value: "basic"
    - name: WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_SOURCE
      value: "messages,trace,accessLog"
    - name: WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL
      value: "error"
```

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Open Liberty provides capabilities to delegate authentication to external providers. Your application users can log in using their existing accounts for social media providers such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 clients. Open Liberty Operator allows to easily configure and manage the single sign-on information for your applications.

Configure and build the application image with single sign-on by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#security).

To specify sensitive information such as client IDs, client secrets and tokens for the login providers you selected in application image, create a `Secret` named `<OpenLibertyApplication_name>-olapp-sso` in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyApplication` instance. In the sample snippets provided below, `OpenLibertyApplication` is named `my-app`, hence secret must be named `my-app-olapp-sso`. Both are in the same namespace called `demo`.

The keys within the `Secret` must follow this naming pattern: `<provider_name>-<sensitive_field_name>`. For example, `google-clientSecret`. Instead of the `-` character in between, you can also use `.` or `_`. For example, `oauth2_userApiToken`.

_Note_: Open Liberty Operator watches for the creation and deletion of the SSO secret as well as any updates to it. Adding or removing keys from Secret will be passed down to the application automatically. However, updating the value of an existing key in `Secret` is not propagated to the application. See [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md#single-sign-on-sso) for solution and an explanation.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  # Name of the secret should be in this format: <OpenLibertyApplication_name>-olapp-sso
  name: my-app-olapp-sso
  # Secret must be created in the same namespace as the OpenLibertyApplication instance
  namespace: demo
type: Opaque
data:
  # The keys must be in this format: <provider_name>-<sensitive_field_name>
  github-clientId: bW9vb29vb28=
  github-clientSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=
  twitter-consumerKey: bW9vb29vb28=
  twitter-consumerSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=
  oidc-clientId: bW9vb29vb28=
  oidc-clientSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=
  oauth2-clientId: bW9vb29vb28=
  oauth2-clientSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=
  oauth2-userApiToken: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=
```

Next, configure single sign-on in `OpenLibertyApplication` CR. At minimum, `sso: {}` should be set in order for the operator to pass the values from the above `Secret` to your application. Refer to the [parameters list](#custom-resource-definition-crd) for additional configurations for `sso`.

In addition, single sign-on requires secured Service and secured Route configured with necessary certificates. Refer to [Certificate Manager Integration](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#certificate-manager-integration) for more information.

To automatically trust certificates from well known identity providers, including social login providers such as Google and Facebook, set environment variable `SEC_TLS_TRUSTDEFAULTCERTS` to `true`. To automatically trust certificates issued by the Kubernetes cluster, set environment variable `SEC_IMPORT_K8S_CERTS` to `true`. Alternatively, you could include the necessary certificates manually when building application image or mounting them using a volume when deploying your application.

In the following example, a self-signed certificate is used for secured Service and Route.

```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: demo
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  env:
    - name: SEC_TLS_TRUSTDEFAULTCERTS
      value: "true"
    - name: SEC_IMPORT_K8S_CERTS
      value: "true"
  sso:
    redirectToRPHostAndPort: redirect-url.mycompany.com
    github:
      hostname: github.mycompany.com
    oauth2:
      - authorizationEndpoint: specify-required-value
        tokenEndpoint: specify-required-value
    oidc:
      - discoveryEndpoint: specify-required-value
  service:
    certificate:
      isCA: true
      issuerRef:
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        name: self-signed
    port: 9443
    type: ClusterIP
  expose: true
  route:
    certificate:
      isCA: true
      issuerRef:
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        name: self-signed
    termination: reencrypt
```

#### Using multiple OIDC and OAuth 2.0 providers (Advanced)

You can use multiple OIDC and OAuth 2.0 providers to authenticate with. First, configure and build application image with multiple OIDC and/or OAuth 2.0 providers. For example, set `ARG SEC_SSO_PROVIDERS="google oidc:provider1,provider2 oauth2:provider3,provider4"` in your Dockerfile. The provider name must be unique and must contain only alphanumeric characters.

Then, use the provider name in SSO `Secret` to specify its client ID and secret. For example, `provider1-clientSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=`. To configure a parameter for the corresponding provider in `OpenLibertyApplication` CR, use `sso.oidc[].id` or `sso.oauth2[].id` parameter.

```yaml
  sso:
    oidc:
      - id: provider1
        discoveryEndpoint: specify-required-value
      - id: provider2
        discoveryEndpoint: specify-required-value
    oauth2:
      - id: provider3
        authorizationEndpoint: specify-required-value
        tokenEndpoint: specify-required-value
      - id: provider4
        authorizationEndpoint: specify-required-value
        tokenEndpoint: specify-required-value
        
```

### Storage for serviceability

The operator makes it easy to use a single storage for serviceability related operations, such as gatherig server traces or dumps (see [Day-2 Operations](#day-2-operations)). The single storage will be shared by all Pods of an `OpenLibertyApplication` instance. This way you don't need to mount a separate storage for each Pod. Your cluster must be configured to automatically bind the `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) to a `PersistentVolume` or you must bind it manually.

You can specify the size of the persisted storage to request using `serviceability.size` parameter. The operator will automatically create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` with the specified size and access modes `ReadWriteMany` and `ReadWriteOnce`. It will be mounted at `/serviceability` inside all Pods of the `OpenLibertyApplication` instance.

```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  serviceability:
    size: 1Gi
```

You can also create the `PersistentVolumeClaim` yourself and specify its name using `serviceability.volumeClaimName` parameter. You must create it in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyApplication` instance.

```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  serviceability:
    volumeClaimName: my-pvc
```

_Once a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is created by operator, its size can not be updated. It will not be deleted when serviceability is disabled or when the `OpenLibertyApplication` is deleted._

### Troubleshooting

See the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) for information on how to investigate and resolve deployment problems.

## Day-2 Operations

### Prerequisite 

 - The corresponding `OpenLibertyApplication` must already have [storage for serviceability](#storage-for-serviceability) configured in order to use the day-2 operations
 - The custom resource (CR) for a day-2 operation must be created in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyApplication`
 
 
 ### Operation discovery
 
To allow auto-discovery of supported day-2 operations from external tools the following annotation has been added to the `OpenLibertyApplication` CRD:

```
  annotations:
    openliberty.io/day2operations: OpenLibertyTrace,OpenLibertyDump
```

Additionally, each day-2 operation CRD has the following annotation which illustrates the k8s `Kind`(s) the operation applies to:

```
  annotations:
    day2operation.openliberty.io/targetKinds: Pod
```

### Request server dump

You can request a snapshot of the server status including different types of server dumps, from an instance of Open Liberty server running inside a `Pod`, using Open Liberty Operator and `OpenLibertyDump` custom resource (CR). To use this feature the `OpenLibertyApplication` needs to have [storage for serviceability](#storage-for-serviceability) already configured. Also, the `OpenLibertyDump` CR must be created in the same namespace as the `Pod` to operate on.

The configurable parameters are:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `podName` | The name of the Pod, which must be in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyDump` CR. |
| `include` | Optional. List of memory dump types to request: _thread,heap,system_  |

Example including heap and thread dump:

```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyDump
metadata:
  name: example-dump
spec:
  podName: Specify_Pod_Name_Here
  include: 
    - thread
    - heap
```

Dump file name will be added to OpenLibertyDump CR status and file will be stored in serviceability folder
using format such as /serviceability/NAMESPACE/POD_NAME/TIMESTAMP.zip

Once the dump has started, the CR can not be re-used to take more dumps. A new CR needs to be created for each server dump.

You can check the status of a dump operation using the `status` field inside the CR YAML. You can also run the command `oc get oldump -o wide` to see the status of all dump operations in the current namespace. 

Note:
_System dump might not work on certain Kubernetes versions, such as OpenShift 4.x_

### Request server traces

You can request server traces, from an instance of Open Liberty server running inside a `Pod`, using Open Liberty Operator and `OpenLibertyTrace` custom resource (CR). To use this feature the `OpenLibertyApplication` must already have [storage for serviceability](#storage-for-serviceability) configured. Also, the `OpenLibertyTrace` CR must be created in the same namespace as the `Pod` to operate on. 

The configurable parameters are:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `podName` | The name of the Pod, which must be in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyTrace` CR. |
| `traceSpecification` | The trace string to be used to selectively enable trace. The default is *=info. |
| `maxFileSize` | The maximum size (in MB) that a log file can reach before it is rolled. To disable this attribute, set the value to 0. By default, the value is 20. This setting does not apply to the `console.log` file. |
| `maxFiles` | If an enforced maximum file size exists, this setting is used to determine how many of each of the logs files are kept. This setting also applies to the number of exception logs that summarize exceptions that occurred on any particular day.  |
| `disable` | Set to _true_ to stop tracing. |

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyTrace
metadata:
  name: example-trace
spec:
  podName: Specify_Pod_Name_Here
  traceSpecification: "*=info:com.ibm.ws.webcontainer*=all"
  maxFileSize: 20
  maxFiles: 5
```
Generated trace files, along with _messages.log_ files, will be in the folder using format _/serviceability/NAMESPACE/POD_NAME/_

Once the trace has started, it can be stopped by setting the `disable` parameter to `true`. Deleting the CR will also stop the tracing. Changing the `podName` will first stop the tracing on the old Pod before enabling traces on the new Pod.

You can check the status of a trace operation using the `status` field inside the CR YAML. You can also run the command `oc get oltrace -o wide` to see the status of all trace operations in the current namespace. 

Note:
_The operator doesn't monitor the Pods. If the Pod is restarted or deleted after the trace is enabled, then the tracing wouldn't be automatically enabled when the Pod comes back up. In that case, the status of the trace operation may not correctly report whether the trace is enabled or not._
