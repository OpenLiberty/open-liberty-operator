= Open Liberty Operator v0.8.0+

The Open Liberty Operator can be used to deploy and manage applications running on Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty into Kubernetes clusters. You can also perform link:++#day-2-operations++[Day-2 operations] such as gathering traces and dumps using the operator.

This documentation refers to the latest codebase.  For documentation and samples of older releases, please check out the link:++https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/releases++[main releases] page and navigate the corresponding tag.

**Important**: This user guide only applies to operator versions **0.8.0 and above**. For operator versions **0.7.1 and below**, refer to this link:++user-guide.adoc++[user guide].

**Important**: If you are upgrading from Open Liberty Operator versions 0.7.1 and below, note that API version of the custom resources (CRs) `OpenLibertyApplication`, `OpenLibertyDump` and `OpenLibertyTrace` have changed. Custom resources with `apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1` are not handled by Open Liberty Operator versions 0.8.0 and above. You must delete existing custom resources with `apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1` and create new custom resources with `apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2`.

== Operator installation

Use the instructions for one of the link:++../deploy/releases++[releases] to install the operator into a Kubernetes cluster.

The Open Liberty Operator can be installed to:

* watch own namespace
* watch another namespace
* watch all namespaces in the cluster

Appropriate cluster roles and bindings are required to watch another namespace or to watch all namespaces in the cluster.

NOTE: The Open Liberty Operator can only interact with resources it is given permission to interact through link:++https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/++[Role-based access control (RBAC)]. Some of the operator features require interacting with resources in other namespaces. In that case, the operator must be installed with correct `ClusterRole` definitions.

== Overview

The architecture of the Open Liberty Operator follows the basic controller pattern:  the Operator container with the controller is deployed into a Pod and listens for incoming resources with `Kind: OpenLibertyApplication`. Creating an `OpenLibertyApplication` custom resource (CR) triggers the Open Liberty Operator to create, update or delete Kubernetes resources needed by the application to run on your cluster.

In addition, Open Liberty Operator makes it easy to perform link:++#day-2-operations++[Day-2 operations] on an Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty server running inside a Pod as part of an `OpenLibertyApplication` instance:
* Gather server traces using resource `Kind: OpenLibertyTrace`
* Generate server dumps using resource `Kind: OpenLibertyDump`

== Configuration

=== Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

Each instance of `OpenLibertyApplication` CR represents the application to be deployed on the cluster:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 9080
  expose: true
  statefulSet:
    storage:
      size: 2Gi
      mountPath: "/logs"
----

The following table lists configurable fields of the `OpenLibertyApplication` CRD. For a complete OpenAPI v3 representation of these values, view the files under `/deploy/releases/_<operator-version>_/kubectl/openliberty-app-crd.yaml`. For example,  the link:++../deploy/releases/0.8.2/kubectl/openliberty-app-crd.yaml++[`OpenLibertyApplication` CRD] for release `0.8.2`.

Each `OpenLibertyApplication` CR must specify `.spec.applicationImage` field. Specifying other fields is optional.

=== Basic usage

Use official link:++https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#container-images++[Open Liberty images and guidelines] to create your application image.

Use the following CR to deploy your application image to a Kubernetes environment:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
----

The `applicationImage` value must be defined in `OpenLibertyApplication` CR. On OpenShift, the operator tries to find an image stream name with the `applicationImage` value. The operator falls back to the registry lookup if it is not able to find any image stream that matches the value. If you want to distinguish an image stream called `my-company/my-app` (project: `my-company`, image stream name: `my-app`) from the Docker Hub `my-company/my-app` image, you can use the full image reference as `docker.io/my-company/my-app`.

To get information on the deployed CR, use either of the following:

[source,yaml]
----
oc get olapp my-liberty-app
oc get olapps my-liberty-app
oc get openlibertyapplication my-liberty-app
----

=== Override console logging environment variable default values (`.spec.env`) image:images/docs_openliberty_logo.png[OL,30] [[override-console-logging-environment-variable-default-values]]

The Open Liberty operator sets environment variables that are related to console logging by default. You can override the console logging default values with your own values in your CR link:#crd-spec-env[`.spec.env`] list.


.Default Environment Variables
|===
| Name                           | Value
| `WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL` | info
| `WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_SOURCE`   | message,accessLog,ffdc,audit
| `WLP_LOGGING_CONSOLE_FORMAT`   | json
|===

To override default values for the console logging environment variables, set your preferred values manually in your CR `.spec.env` list. For information about values that you can set, see the Open Liberty link:++https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/logging.html++[logging] documentation.

The following example shows a CR `.spec.env` list that sets nondefault values for the console logging environment variables.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  env:

=== Configuring single sign-on (SSO) (`.spec.sso`) image:images/docs_openliberty_logo.png[OL,30] [[configuring-single-sign-on-sso]]

An administrator can configure single sign-on (SSO) for Open Liberty operators to authenticate and manage users. Authentication can be delegated to external providers, such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 clients.

==== Procedure
1. Configure and build the application image with single sign-on following the instructions in link:++https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#container-images++[Open Liberty images and guidelines] and then link:++https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker/blob/main/SECURITY.md#single-sign-on-configuration++[Configuring Security: Single Sign-On configuration].
2. Complete one of these choices to configure SSO in your operator.
  - link:#configuring-sso-with-specified-client-ids-and-secrets[Configuring SSO with specified client IDs and secrets]
  - link:#configuring-sso-automatic-registration-with-oidc-providers[Configuring SSO automatic registration with OIDC providers]
  - link:#configuring-multiple-oidc-and-oauth-2-0-providers[Configuring multiple OIDC and OAuth 2.0 providers]

==== Configuring SSO with specified client IDs and secrets [[configuring-sso-with-specified-client-ids-and-secrets]]

The operator can specify a client ID and secret in advance. A disadvantage to this configuration is that the client ID and secret must be supplied for registration repetitively, rather than link:#configuring-sso-automatic-registration-with-oidc-providers[automatically with the provider administrator supplying the information] needed for registration one time.

1. Create a secret that specifies sensitive information such as client IDs, client secrets, and tokens for the login providers you selected in application image.
Create the `Secret` named `OpenLibertyApplication_name-olapp-sso` in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyApplication` instance. In the following sample snippets, `OpenLibertyApplication` is named `my-app`, so the secret must be named `my-app-olapp-sso`. Both are in the same namespace called `demo`. 

- The keys within the `Secret` must follow the `_provider_name_-_sensitive_field_name_` naming pattern. For example, `google-clientSecret`. Instead of a `-` character in between, you can also use `.` or `_`. For example, `oauth2_userApiToken`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    # Name of the secret should be in this format: <OpenLibertyApplication_name>-olapp-sso
    name: my-app-olapp-sso
    # Secret must be created in the same namespace as the OpenLibertyApplication instance
    namespace: demo
  type: Opaque
  data:
    # The keys must be in this format: <provider_name>-<sensitive_field_name>
    github-clientId: bW9vb29vb28=
    github-clientSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=

    oauth2-clientSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=
    oauth2-userApiToken: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=
----
- The operator watches for the creation and deletion of the SSO secret and any updates to it. Adding, updating, or removing keys from the secret are passed down to the application automatically.

2. Configure single sign-on in the OpenLibertyApplication custom resource (CR). At minimum, set the `.spec.sso: {}` field so that the operator can pass the values from the secret to your application. Refer to the link:#crd-sso[OpenLibertyApplication CR] for more SSO configurations.

3. Configure secured `Service` and secured `Route` with necessary certificates. Refer to link:#specifying-certificates-for-a-secret-route-and-service[Certificates] for more information.

4. To automatically trust certificates from popular identity providers, including social login providers such as Google and Facebook, set the `SEC_TLS_TRUSTDEFAULTCERTS` environment variable to `true`. To automatically trust certificates issued by the Kubernetes cluster, set environment variable `SEC_IMPORT_K8S_CERTS` to `true`. Alternatively, you can include the necessary certificates manually when building application image or mounting them using a volume when you deploy your application.

----

==== Configuring SSO automatic registration with OIDC providers [[configuring-sso-automatic-registration-with-oidc-providers]]

The operator can request a client ID and client secret from providers, rather than requiring them in advance. This ability can simplify deployment, as the provider administrator can supply the information that is needed for registration one time, instead of supplying client IDs and secrets repetitively. The callback URL from the provider to the client is supplied by the operator, so doesn't need to be known in advance.

1. Add attributes that are named `_provider_name_-_autoreg-field_name_` to the Kubernetes secret.
First, the operator makes an https request to the `.spec.sso.oidc[].discoveryEndpoint` field to obtain URLs for subsequent REST calls. Next, it makes other REST calls to the provider and obtains a client ID and client secret. The Kubernetes secret is updated with the obtained values.

2. For Red Hat® Single Sign-on (RH-SSO), you can set the `.spec.sso.oidc[].userNameAttribute` field to `preferred_username` to obtain the user ID that was used to log in. For IBM Security Verify, set the field to `given_name`.
The following example secret is tested on Red Hat OpenShift® with RH-SSO and IBM® Security Verify.
+

==== Configuring multiple OIDC and OAuth 2.0 providers [[configuring-multiple-oidc-and-oauth-2-0-providers]]

You can authenticate with multiple OIDC and OAuth 2.0 providers.

1. Configure and build application image with multiple OIDC or OAuth 2.0 providers.
For example, set the provider name in your Dockerfile. The provider name must be unique and must contain only alphanumeric characters.
+
[source,Dockerfile]
----
ARG SEC_SSO_PROVIDERS="google oidc:provider1,provider2 oauth2:provider3,provider4"
----

2. Use the provider name in an SSO `Secret` to specify its client ID and secret.
For example, the following `Secret` sets `provider1-clientSecret: dGhlbGF1Z2hpbmdjb3c=` for a client ID and secret.

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1

----

3. Configure a field for each corresponding provider in the `OpenLibertyApplication` CR. Use one or both of the `.spec.sso.oidc[].id` and `.spec.sso.oauth2[].id` fields.

+

=== Storage for serviceability (`.spec.serviceability`) image:images/docs_openliberty_logo.png[OL,30] [[storage-for-serviceability]]

The operator provides single storage for serviceability.

The operator makes it easy to use a single storage for link:#day-2-operations[Day-2 Operations] that are related to serviceability, such as gathering link:#day-2-trace[server traces] or link:#day-2-dump[server dumps]. The single storage is shared by all pods of a `OpenLibertyApplication` instance. You don't need to mount a separate storage for each pod.

Your cluster must be configured to automatically bind the link:++https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims++[PersistentVolumeClaim] (PVC) to a PersistentVolume or you must bind it manually.

You can specify the size of the persisted storage to request with the link:#crd-spec-serviceability-size[`.spec.serviceability.size`] parameter.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  serviceability:
    size: 1Gi
----

You can specify which storage class to request with the link:#crd-spec-serviceability-storageClassName[`.spec.serviceability.storageClassName`] parameter if you don’t want to use the default storage class. The operator automatically creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` with the specified size and access mode `ReadWriteMany`. It is mounted at `/serviceability` inside all pods of the `OpenLibertyApplication` instance.

Alternatively, you can create the PersistentVolumeClaim and specify its name with the link:#crd-spec-serviceability-volumeClaimName[`.spec.serviceability.volumeClaimName`] parameter. You must create it in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyApplication` instance.


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  serviceability:
    size: 1Gi
----

You can also create the `PersistentVolumeClaim` yourself and specify its name using `.spec.serviceability.volumeClaimName` field. You must create it in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyApplication` instance.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: my-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  serviceability:
    volumeClaimName: my-pvc
----

_Once a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is created by operator, its size can not be updated. It will not be deleted when serviceability is disabled or when the `OpenLibertyApplication` is deleted._

=== Reference image streams (`.spec.applicationImage`) [[reference-image-streams]]

To deploy an image from an image stream, you must specify a **`.spec.applicationImage`** field in your CR.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: my-namespace/my-image-stream:1.0
----

The previous example looks up the `1.0` tag from the `my-image-stream` image stream in the `my-namespace` project and populates the CR `.status.imageReference` field with the exact referenced image similar to the following one: `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/my-namespace/my-image-stream@sha256:*`. The operator watches the specified image stream and deploys new images as new ones are available for the specified tag.

To reference an image stream, the `.spec.applicationImage` field must follow the `<project name>/<image stream name>[:<tag>]` format. If `<project name>` or `<tag>` is not specified, the operator defaults the values to the namespace of the CR and the value of `latest`, respectively. For example, the `applicationImage: my-image-stream` configuration is the same as the `applicationImage: my-namespace/my-image-stream:latest` configuration.

The Operator tries to find an image stream name first with the `<project name>/<image stream name>[:<tag>]` format and falls back to the registry lookup if it is not able to find any image stream that matches the value.

NOTE: This feature is only available if you are running on Red Hat OpenShift. The operator requires `ClusterRole` permissions if the image stream resource is in another namespace.

=== Create a service account (`.spec.serviceAccountName`) [[create-a-service-account]]

The operator can create a `ServiceAccount` resource when deploying an `OpenLibertyApplication` custom resource (CR). If `.spec.serviceAccountName` is not specified in a CR, the operator creates a service account with the same name as the CR (e.g. `my-app`).

Users can also specify `serviceAccountName` when they want to create a service account manually.

If applications require specific permissions but still want the operator to create a `ServiceAccount`, users can still manually create a role binding to bind a role to the service account created by the operator. To learn more about Role-based access control (RBAC), see Kubernetes link:++https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/++[documentation].

=== Add or change labels (`.metadata.labels`) [[add-or-change-labels]]

By default, the operator adds the following labels into all resources created
for an `OpenLibertyApplication` CR:

.Open Liberty operator label default values
|===
| Label                          | Default value                  | Description

| `app.kubernetes.io/instance`   | `metadata.name`                | A unique name or identifier for this component. You cannot change the default.
| `app.kubernetes.io/name`       | `metadata.name`                | A name that represents this component.
| `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` | `open-liberty-operator`   | The tool that manages this component.
| `app.kubernetes.io/component`  | `backend`                      | The type of component that is created. For a full list, see the link:++https://github.com/gorkem/app-labels/blob/master/labels-annotation-for-openshift.adoc#labels++[Red Hat OpenShift documentation].
| `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`    | `applicationName`              | The name of the higher-level application that this component is a part of. If the component is not a stand-alone application, configure this label.
| `app.kubernetes.io/version`    | `version`                      | The version of the component.
|===

You can add new labels or overwrite existing labels, excluding the `app.kubernetes.io/instance` label. To set labels, specify them in your CR as key-value pairs in the `.metadata.labels` field.

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    my-label-key: my-label-value
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
----

After the initial deployment of the CR, any changes to its labels are applied only if a `spec` field is updated.

When running in Red Hat OpenShift, there are additional labels and annotations that are standard on the platform. Overwrite defaults where applicable and add any labels from the link:++https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-labels/blob/master/labels-annotation-for-openshift.adoc#labels++[Red Hat OpenShift list] that are not set by default using the previous instructions.

=== Add annotations (`.metadata.annotations`) [[add-annotations]]

To add new annotations into all resources created for a `OpenLibertyApplication`, specify them in your CR as key-value pairs in the `.metadata.annotations` field. Annotations in a CR override any annotations specified on a resource, except for the annotations set on `Service` with `.spec.service.annotations`.

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: my-app
  annotations:
    my-annotation-key: my-annotation-value
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
----

After the initial deployment of `OpenLibertyApplication`, any changes to its annotations are applied only when one of the fields from `spec` is updated.

When running in Red Hat OpenShift, there are additional annotations that are standard on the platform. Overwrite defaults where applicable and add any labels from the link:++https://github.com/gorkem/app-labels/blob/master/labels-annotation-for-openshift.adoc#labels++[Red Hat OpenShift list] that are not set by default using the previous instructions.

=== Set environment variables for an application container (`.spec.env` or `.spec.envFrom`) [[set-environment-variables-for-an-application-container]]

To set environment variables for your application container, specify `.spec.env` or `.spec.envFrom` fields in a CR. The environment variables can come directly from key-value pairs, `ConfigMap`, or `Secret`. The environment variables set by the `.spec.env` or `.spec.envFrom` fields override any environment variables that are specified in the container image.

Use `.spec.envFrom` to define all data in a `ConfigMap` or a `Secret` as environment variables in a container. Keys from `ConfigMap` or `Secret` resources become environment variable names in your container. The following CR sets key-value pairs in `.spec.env` and `.spec.envFrom` fields.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  env:
    - name: DB_NAME
      value: "database"
    - name: DB_PORT
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: db-config
          key: db-port
    - name: DB_USERNAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-credential
          key: adminUsername
    - name: DB_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-credential
          key: adminPassword
  envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: env-configmap
    - secretRef:
        name: env-secrets
----

For another example that uses `.spec.envFrom[].secretRef`, see link:#setting-up-basic-authentication-credentials-by-using-environment-variables[Setting up basic authentication credentials by using environment variables].

=== Setting up basic authentication credentials by using environment variables (`.spec.envFrom[].secretRef`) [[setting-up-basic-authentication-credentials-by-using-environment-variables]]

An administrator can use the `username` and `password` container environment variables for basic authentication credentials.

1. Create a secret with your wanted `username` and `password` values in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Modify your `OpenLibertyApplication` CR to add a `.spec.envFrom` parameter definition that references your `Secret`.
For example, add the following `.spec.envFrom[].secretRef` parameter to your CR and replace `_basic-auth_` with your secret.
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  envFrom:
   - secretRef:
      name: basic-auth
----
3. Ensure that your application container can access the `Secret`.

The `.spec.envFrom` configuration sets two environment variables for your application container, `username` and `password`, and uses the `username` and `password` values in your secret.

=== Configure multiple application instances for high availability (`.spec.replicas` or `.spec.autoscaling`) [[configure-multiple-application-instances-for-high-availability]]

To run multiple instances of your application for high availability, use the `.spec.replicas` field for multiple static instances or the `.spec.autoscaling` field for auto-scaling, which autonomically creates or deletes instances based on resource consumption. The `.spec.autoscaling`.maxReplicas and `.spec.resources.requests.cpu` fields are required for auto-scaling.

=== Set privileges and permissions for a pod or container (`.spec.securityContext`) [[set-privileges-and-permissions-for-a-pod-or-container]]

A security context controls privilege and permission settings for a pod or application container. By default, the operator sets several `.spec.securityContext` parameters for an application container as shown in the following example.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      securityContext:
        capabilities:
          drop:
            - ALL
        privileged: false
        runAsNonRoot: true
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
----
To override the default values or set more parameters, change the `.spec.securityContext` parameters, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  securityContext:
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    runAsUser: 1001
    seLinuxOptions:
      level: "s0:c123,c456"
----
For more information, see link:++https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container++[Set the security context for a Container]. For more information about security context parameters, see link:++https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#securitycontext-v1-core++[SecurityContext v1 core].

NOTE: If your Kubernetes cluster does not generate a user ID and `.spec.securityContext.runAsUser` is not specified, the user ID defaults to the value in the image metadata. If the image does not have a user ID specified either, you will have to assign a user ID through  `.spec.securityContext.runAsUser` to meet `.spec.securityContext.runAsNonRoot` requirement.

=== Persist resources (`.spec.statefulSet` and `.spec.volumeMounts`) [[persist-resources]]
If storage is specified in the `OpenLibertyApplication` CR, the operator can create a `StatefulSet` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` for each pod. If storage is not specified, `StatefulSet` resource is created without persistent storage.

The following CR definition uses `.spec.statefulSet.storage` to provide basic storage. The operator creates a `StatefulSet` with the size of `1Gi` that mounts to the `/data` folder.
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  statefulSet:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
      mountPath: "/data"
----
An Open Liberty operator CR definition can provide more advanced storage. With the following CR definition, the operator creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` called `pvc` with the size of `1Gi` and `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. The operator enables users to provide an entire `.spec.statefulSet.storage.volumeClaimTemplate` for full control over the automatically created `PersistentVolumeClaim`. To persist to more than one folder, the CR definition uses the `.spec.volumeMounts` field instead of `.spec.statefulSet.storage.mountPath`.
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  volumeMounts:
  - name: pvc
    mountPath: /data_1
    subPath: data_1
  - name: pvc
    mountPath: /data_2
    subPath: data_2
  statefulSet:
    storage:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        metadata:
          name: pvc
        spec:
          accessModes:
          - "ReadWriteMany"
          storageClassName: 'glusterfs'
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 1Gi
----

NOTE: After `StatefulSet` is created, the persistent storage and `PersistentVolumeClaim` cannot be added or changed.

The following CR definition does not specify storage and creates `StatefulSet` resources without persistent storage. You can create `StatefulSet` resources without storage if you require only ordering and uniqueness of a set of pods.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  statefulSet: {}
----

=== Monitor resources (`.spec.monitoring`) [[monitor-resources]]

An Open Liberty operator can create a `ServiceMonitor` resource to integrate with Prometheus Operator.

NOTE: The operator monitoring does not support integration with Knative Service. Prometheus Operator is required to use `ServiceMonitor`.

At minimum, provide a label for Prometheus set on `ServiceMonitor` objects. In the following example, the `.spec.monitoring` label is `apps-prometheus`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  monitoring:
    labels:
       app-prometheus: ''
    endpoints:
    - interval: '30s'
      basicAuth:
        username:
          key: username
          name: metrics-secret
        password:
          key: password
          name: metrics-secret
      tlsConfig:
        insecureSkipVerify: true
----

For more advanced monitoring, set many `ServiceMonitor` parameters such as authentication secret with link:++https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#endpoint++[Prometheus Endpoint].

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  monitoring:
    labels:
       app-prometheus: ''
    endpoints:
    - interval: '30s'
      basicAuth:
        username:
          key: username
          name: metrics-secret
        password:
          key: password
          name: metrics-secret
      tlsConfig:

=== Specify multiple service ports (`.spec.service.port*` and `.spec.monitoring.endpoints`) [[specify-multiple-service-ports]]

To provide multiple service ports in addition to the primary service port, configure the primary service port with the `.spec.service.port`, `.spec.service.targetPort`, `.spec.service.portName`, and `.spec.service.nodePort` fields. The primary port is exposed from the container that runs the application and the port values are used to configure the Route (or Ingress), Service binding and Knative service.

To specify an alternative port for Service Monitor, use the `.spec.monitoring.endpoints` field and specify either the `port` or `targetPort` field, otherwise it defaults to the primary port.

Specify the primary port with the `.spec.service.port` field and additional ports with the `.spec.service.ports` field as shown in the following example.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0

----

=== Configure probes (`.spec.probes`) [[configure-probes]]
Probes are health checks on an application container to determine whether it is alive or ready to receive traffic. The Open Liberty operator has startup, liveness, and readiness probes.

Probes are not enabled in applications by default. To enable a probe with the default values, set the probe parameters to `{}`. The following example enables all 3 probes to use default values.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  probes:
    startup: {}
    liveness: {}
    readiness: {}
----

The following code snippet shows the default values for the **startup** probe (`.spec.probes.startup`).
[source,yaml]
----
httpGet:
  path: /health/started
  port: 9443
  scheme: HTTPS
timeoutSeconds: 2
periodSeconds: 10
failureThreshold: 20
----

The following code snippet shows the default values for the **liveness** probe (`.spec.probes.liveness`).
[source,yaml]
----
httpGet:
  path: /health/live
  port: 9443
  scheme: HTTPS
initialDelaySeconds: 60
timeoutSeconds: 2
periodSeconds: 10
failureThreshold: 3
----

The following code snippet shows the default values for the **readiness** probe (`.spec.probes.readiness`).
[source,yaml]
----
httpGet:
  path: /health/ready
  port: 9443
  scheme: HTTPS
initialDelaySeconds: 10
timeoutSeconds: 2
periodSeconds: 10
failureThreshold: 10
----

To override a default value, specify a different value. The following example overrides a liveness probe initial delay default of `60` seconds and sets the initial delay to `90` seconds.
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  probes:
    liveness:
      initialDelaySeconds: 90
----

When a probe **initialDelaySeconds** parameter is set to `0`, the default value is used. To set a probe initial delay to `0`, define the probe instead of using the default probe. The following example overrides the default value and sets the initial delay to `0`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  probes:
    liveness:
      httpGet:
        path: "/health/live"
        port: 9443
      initialDelaySeconds: 0
----


=== Deploy serverless applications with Knative (`.spec.createKnativeService`) [[deploy-serverless-applications-with-knative]]

If link:++https://knative.dev/docs/++[Knative] is installed on a Kubernetes cluster, to deploy serverless applications with Knative on the cluster, the operator creates a link:++https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/docs/spec/spec.md#service++[Knative Service] resource which manages the entire life cycle of a workload. To create a Knative service, set `.spec.createKnativeService` to `true`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  createKnativeService: true
----

The operator creates a Knative service in the cluster and populates the resource with applicable `OpenLibertyApplication` fields. Also, it ensures non-Knative resources such as Kubernetes `Service`, `Route`, and `Deployment` are deleted.


The CRD fields that can populate the Knative service resource include `.spec.applicationImage`, `.spec.serviceAccountName`, `.spec.probes.liveness`, `.spec.probes.readiness`, `.spec.service.port`, `.spec.volumes`, `.spec.volumeMounts`, `.spec.env`, `.spec.envFrom`, `.spec.pullSecret` and `.spec.pullPolicy`. Startup probe is not fully supported by Knative, thus `.spec.probes.startup` does not apply when Knative service is enabled.

When using private registries with Knative / OpenShift Serverless  `.spec.pullSecret` must be specified. OpenShift global
pull secret can not be used to provide registry credentials to Knative Services.


For details on how to configure Knative for tasks such as enabling HTTPS connections and setting up a custom domain, see the link:++https://knative.dev/docs/serving/++[Knative documentation].

Autoscaling fields in `OpenLibertyApplication` are not used to configure Knative Pod Autoscaler (KPA). To learn how to configure KPA, see link:++https://knative.dev/docs/serving/configuring-the-autoscaler/++[Configuring the Autoscaler].

=== Expose applications externally (`.spec.expose`, `.spec.createKnativeService`, `.spec.route`) [[expose-applications-externally]]

Expose an application externally with a Route, Knative Route, or Ingress resource.

To expose an application externally with a route in a non-Knative deployment, set `.spec.expose` to true.

The operator creates a secured route based on the application service when `.spec.manageTLS` is enabled. To use custom certificates, see information about link:#specifying-certificates-for-a-secret-route-and-service[`.spec.service.certificateSecretRef` and `.spec.route.certificateSecretRef`].

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  expose: true
----

To expose an application externally with Ingress in a non-Knative deployment, complete the following steps.

1. To use the `Ingress` resource to expose your cluster, install an `Ingress` controller such a Nginx or Traefik.
2. Ensure that a `Route` resource is not on the cluster. The Ingress resource is created only if the `Route` resource is not available on the cluster.
3. To use the `Ingress` resource, set the `defaultHostName` variable in the `open-liberty-operator` `ConfigMap` object to a hostname such as `mycompany.com`.
    - For Runtime Component operator, search for the `runtime-component-operator` `ConfigMap`.
4. Enable TLS. Generate a certificate and specify the secret that contains the certificate with the `.spec.route.certificateSecretRef` field.
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  expose: true
  route:
    certificateSecretRef: mycompany-tls
----
5. Specify `.spec.route.annotations` to configure the `Ingress` resource. Annotations such as Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik, and others are specific to the `Ingress` controller implementation.
The following example specifies annotations, an existing TLS secret, and a custom hostname.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  expose: true
  route:
    annotations:
      # You can use this annotation to specify the name of the ingress controller to use.
      # You can install multiple ingress controllers to address different types of incoming traffic such as an external or internal DNS.
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"

      # The following nginx annotation enables a secure pod connection:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: true
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"

      # The following traefik annotation enables a secure pod connection:
      traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/service.serversscheme: https

    # Use a custom hostname for the Ingress
    host: app-v1.mycompany.com
    # Reference a pre-existing TLS secret:
    certificateSecretRef: mycompany-tls
----

To expose an application as a Knative service, set link:#deploy-serverless-applications-with-knative[`.spec.createKnativeService`] and `.spec.expose` to `true`. The operator creates an unsecured Knative route. To configure secure HTTPS connections for your Knative deployment, see link:++https://knative.dev/docs/serving/using-a-tls-cert/++[Configuring HTTPS with TLS certificates].

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  createKnativeService: true
  expose: true
----

=== Allowing or limiting incoming traffic (`.spec.networkPolicy`) [[allowing-or-limiting-incoming-traffic]]

By default, network policies for an application isolate incoming traffic.

* The default network policy created for applications that are not exposed limits incoming traffic to pods in the same namespace that are part of the same application. Traffic is limited to only the ports that are configured by the service.
* Red Hat OpenShift supports network policies by default. For exposed applications on Red Hat OpenShift, the network policy allows incoming traffic from the Red Hat OpenShift ingress controller on the ports in the service configuration. The network policy also allows incoming traffic from the Red Hat OpenShift monitoring stack.
* For exposed applications on other Kubernetes platforms, the network policy allows incoming traffic from any pods in any namespace on the ports in the service configuration. For deployments to other Kubernetes platforms, ensure that your network plug-in supports the link:++https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#prerequisites++[Kubernetes network policies].

To disable the creation of network policies for an application, set link:#crd-networkPolicy-disable[`.spec.networkPolicy.disable`] to true.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  networkPolicy:
    disable: true
----

You can change the network policy to allow incoming traffic from specific namespaces or pods. By default, `.spec.networkPolicy.namespaceLabels` is set to the same namespace to which the application is deployed, and `.spec.networkPolicy.fromLabels` is set to pods that belong to the same application specified by `.spec.applicationName`. The following example allows incoming traffic from pods that are labeled with the frontend role and are in the same namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  networkPolicy:
    fromLabels:
      role: frontend
----

The following example allows incoming traffic from pods that belong to the same application in the `example` namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  networkPolicy:
    namespaceLabels:
      kubernetes.io/metadata.name: example
----

The following example allows incoming traffic from pods that are labeled with the `frontend` role in the `example` namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  networkPolicy:
    namespaceLabels:
      kubernetes.io/metadata.name: example
    fromLabels:
      role: frontend

=== Bind applications with operator-managed backing services (`.status.binding.name` and `.spec.service.bindable`) [[bind-applications-with-operator-managed-backing-services]]

The link:++https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator++[Service Binding Operator] enables application developers to bind applications together with operator-managed backing services. If the Service Binding Operator is installed on your cluster, you can bind applications by creating a `ServiceBindingRequest` custom resource.

You can configure an Open Liberty application to behave as a link:++https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#provisioned-service++[Provisioned Service] that is defined by the link:++https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec++[Service Binding Specification]. According to the specification, a Provisioned Service resource must define a `.status.binding.name` that refers to a `Secret`. To expose your application as a Provisioned Service, set the link:#crd-spec-service-bindable[`.spec.service.bindable`] field to a value of true. The operator creates a _binding secret_ that is named `CR_NAME-expose-binding` and adds the `host`, `port`, `protocol`, `basePath`, and `uri` entries to the secret.

To override the default values for the entries in the binding secret or to add new entries to the secret, create an _override secret_ that is named `CR_NAME-expose-binding-override` and add any entries to the secret. The operator reads the content of the override secret and overrides the default values in the binding secret.

After an Open Liberty application is exposed as a Provisioned Service, a service binding request can refer to the application as a backing service.

The instructions that follow show how to bind Open Liberty applications as services or producers to other workloads (such as pods or deployments). 

NOTE: Two Open Liberty applications that are deployed through the Open Liberty Operator cannot be bound.


- Set up the Service Binding operator to access Open Liberty applications.
By default, the Service Binding operator does not have permission to interact with Open Liberty applications that are deployed through the Open Liberty operator. You must create two RoleBindings to give the Service Binding operator view and edit access for Open Liberty applications.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift dashboard, navigate to *User Management* > *RoleBindings*.
2. Select *Create binding*.
3. Set the *Binding type* to `Cluster-wide role binding` (`ClusterRoleBinding`).
4. Enter a name for the binding. Choose a name that is related to service bindings and view access for Open Liberty applications.
5. For the role name, enter `openlibertyapplications.apps.openliberty.io-v1beta2-view`.
6. Set the *Subject* to `ServiceAccount`.
7. A *Subject namespace* menu appears. Select `openshift-operators`.
8. In the *Subject name* field, enter `service-binding-operator`.
9. Click *Create*.

+
Now that you have set up the first role binding, navigate to the `RoleBindings` list and click *Create binding* again. Set up edit access by using the following instructions.

10. Set *Binding type* to `Cluster-wide role binding` (`ClusterRoleBinding`).
11. Enter a name for the binding. Choose a name that is related to service bindings and edit access for Open Liberty applications.
12. In the *Role name* field, enter `openlibertyapplications.apps.openliberty.io-v1beta2-edit`.
13. Set *Subject* to `ServiceAccount`.
14. In the *Subject namespace* list, select `openshift-operators`.
15. In the *Subject name* field, type `service-binding-operator`.
16. Click *Create*.

+ 
Service bindings from Open Liberty applications (or "services") to pods or deployments (or "workloads") now succeed. After a binding is made, the bound workload restarts or scales to mount the binding secret to `/bindings` in all containers.

- Set up a service binding by using the Red Hat method. For more information, see the link:++https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/applications/connecting_applications_to_services/getting-started-with-service-binding.html#getting-started-with-service-binding++[Red Hat documentation] or the link:++https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/03/11/binding-workloads-services-made-easier-service-binding-operator-red-hat?_ga=2.71595863.551583477.1682431368-578520176.1682431368#use_the_service_binding_operator++[Red Hat tutorial].

1. On the Red Hat OpenShift web dashboard, click *Administrator* in the sidebar and select *Developer*.
2. In the Topology view for the current namespace, hover over the border of the Open Liberty application to be bound as a service, and drag an arrow to the Pod or Deployment workload. A tooltip appears entitled Create Service Binding.
3. The Create Service Binding window opens. Change the name to value that is fewer than 63 characters. The Service Binding operator might fail to mount the secret as a volume if the name exceeds 63 characters.
4. Click *Create*.
5. A sidebar opens. To see the status of the binding, click the name of the secret and then scroll until the status appears.
6. Check the pod/deployment workload and verify that a volume is mounted. You can also open a terminal session into a container and run `ls /bindings`.

- Set up a service binding using the Spec API Tech Preview / Community method.

+
This method is newer than the Red Hat method but achieves the same results. You must add a label to your Open Liberty application, such as `app=frontend`, if it does not have any unique labels. Set the binding to use a label selector so that the Service Binding operator looks for a Open Liberty application with a specific label.

1. Install the Service Binding operator by using the Red Hat OpenShift Operator Catalog.
2. Select *Operators* > *Installed Operators* and set the namespace to the same one used by both your Open Liberty application and pod/deployment workload.
3. Open the Service Binding (Spec API Tech Preview) page.
4. Click Create *ServiceBinding*.
5. Choose a short name for the binding. Names that exceed 63 characters might cause the binding secret volume mount to fail.
6. Expand the *Service* section.
7. In the *Api Version* field, enter `apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2`.
8. In the *Kind* field, enter `OpenLibertyApplication`.
9. In the *Name* field, enter the name of your application. You can get this name from the list of applications on the Open Liberty operator page.
10. Expand the *Workload* section.
11. Set the *Api Version* field to the value of apiVersion in your target workload YAML. For example, if the workload is a deployment, the value is `apps/v1`.
12. Set the Kind field to the value of kind in your target workload YAML. For example, if the workload is a deployment, the value is `Deployment`.
13. Expand the *Selector* subsection, and then expand the *Match Expressions* subsection.
14. Click *Add Match Expression*.
15. In the *Key* field, enter the label key that you set earlier. For example, for the label `app=frontend`, the key is `app`).
16. In the *Operator* field, enter `Exists`.
17. Expand the *Values* subsection and click *Add Value*.
18. In the *Value* field, enter the label value that you set earlier. For example, if using the label `app=frontend`, the value is `frontend`.
19. Click *Create*.
20. Check the Pod/Deployment workload and verify that a volume is mounted, either by scrolling down or by opening a terminal session into a container and running `ls /bindings`.

=== Limit a pod to run on specified nodes (`.spec.affinity`) [[limit-a-pod-to-run-on-specified-nodes]]
Use link:#crd-spec-affinity[`.spec.affinity`] to constrain a Pod to run only on specified nodes.

To set required labels for pod scheduling on specific nodes, use the `.spec.affinity.nodeAffinityLabels` field.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  affinity:
    nodeAffinityLabels:
      customNodeLabel: label1, label2
      customNodeLabel2: label3
----

The following example requires a `large` node type and preferences for two zones, which are named `zoneA` and `zoneB`.

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: test
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key:  node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
            operator: In
            values:
            - large
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 60
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - zoneA
      - weight: 20
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - zoneB
----

Use pod affinity and anti-affinity to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled based on labels on pods that are already running on the node rather than based on labels on node.

The following example shows that pod affinity is required and that the pods for `Service-A` and `Service-B` must be in the same zone. Through pod anti-affinity, it is preferable not to schedule `Service_B` and `Service_C` on the same host.

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: Service-B
  namespace: test
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0

=== Specifying certificates for a secret Route and Service (`.spec.service.certificateSecretRef` and `.spec.route.certificateSecretRef`) [[specifying-certificates-for-a-secret-route-and-service]]

Specify your own certificate for a secret `Route` with the `OpenLibertyApplication` CR `.spec.route.certificateSecretRef` parameter. Specify your own certificate for a secret `Service` with the `.spec.service.certificateSecretRef` parameter.

The following examples specify certificates for a route.

For `.spec.route.certificateSecretRef`, replace `my-app-rt-tls` with the name of a secret that contains TLS key, certificate, and CA to use in the route. It can also contain destination CA certificate.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: quay.io/my-repo/my-app:1.0
  expose: true
  route:
    host: myapp.mycompany.com
    termination: reencrypt
    certificateSecretRef: my-app-rt-tls
  service:
    port: 9443
----
The following example manually provides a route secret. For the secret, replace `my-app-rt-tls` with the name of the secret. For a route, the following keys are valid in the secret.

* `ca.crt`
* `destCA.crt`
* `tls.crt`
* `tls.key`

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-app-rt-tls
data:
  ca.crt: >-
    Certificate Authority public certificate...(base64)
  tls.crt: >-
    Route public certificate...(base64)
  tls.key: >-
    Route private key...(base64)
  destCA.crt: >-
    Pod/Service certificate Certificate Authority (base64). Might be required when using reencrypt termination policy.
type: kubernetes.io/tls
----

For an example that uses `.spec.route.certificateSecretRef` and makes applications available externally, see the link:#expose-applications-externally[`.spec.expose` examples].

== Troubleshooting

See the link:++troubleshooting.adoc++[troubleshooting guide] for information on how to investigate and resolve deployment problems.

== Day-2 Operations [[day-2-operations]]

=== Prerequisite

 - The corresponding `OpenLibertyApplication` must already have link:++#storage-for-serviceability++[storage for serviceability] configured in order to use the day-2 operations
 - The custom resource (CR) for a day-2 operation must be created in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyApplication`


=== Operation discovery

To allow auto-discovery of supported day-2 operations from external tools the following annotation has been added to the `OpenLibertyApplication` CRD:

[source,yaml]
----
  annotations:
    openliberty.io/day2operations: OpenLibertyTrace,OpenLibertyDump
----

Additionally, each day-2 operation CRD has the following annotation which illustrates the k8s `Kind`(s) the operation applies to:

[source,yaml]
----
  annotations:
    day2operation.openliberty.io/targetKinds: Pod
----

=== Request server dump [[day-2-dump]]

You can request a snapshot of the server status including different types of server dumps, from an instance of Liberty server running inside a `Pod`, using Open Liberty Operator and `OpenLibertyDump` custom resource (CR). To use this feature the `OpenLibertyApplication` needs to have link:++#storage-for-serviceability++[storage for serviceability] already configured. Also, the `OpenLibertyDump` CR must be created in the same namespace as the `Pod` to operate on.

The configurable fields are:

.Configurable Dump Fields
|===
| Field | Description
| `podName` | The name of the Pod, which must be in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyDump` CR.
| `include` | Optional. List of memory dump types to request: _thread,heap,system_
|===

Example including heap and thread dump:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyDump
metadata:
  name: example-dump
spec:
  podName: Specify_Pod_Name_Here
  include:
    - thread
    - heap
----

The dump file name is added to the `OpenLibertyDump` CR status and file is stored in the `serviceability` folder with a format such as `/serviceability/_namespace_/_pod_name_/_timestamp_.zip`

Once the dump has started, the CR can not be re-used to take more dumps. A new CR needs to be created for each server dump.

You can check the status of a dump operation using the `status` field inside the CR YAML. You can also run the command `oc get oldump -o wide` to see the status of all dump operations in the current namespace.

Note:
_System dump might not work on certain Kubernetes versions, such as OpenShift 4.x_

=== Request server traces [[day-2-trace]]

You can request server traces, from an instance of Liberty server running inside a `Pod`, using Open Liberty Operator and `OpenLibertyTrace` custom resource (CR). To use this feature the `OpenLibertyApplication` must already have link:++#storage-for-serviceability++[storage for serviceability] configured. Also, the `OpenLibertyTrace` CR must be created in the same namespace as the `Pod` to operate on.

The configurable fields are:

.Configurable Trace Fields
|===
| Field | Description
| `podName` | The name of the Pod, which must be in the same namespace as the `OpenLibertyTrace` CR.
| `traceSpecification` | The trace string to be used to selectively enable trace. The default is *=info.
| `maxFileSize` | The maximum size (in MB) that a log file can reach before it is rolled. To disable this attribute, set the value to 0. By default, the value is 20. This setting does not apply to the `console.log` file.
| `maxFiles` | If an enforced maximum file size exists, this setting is used to determine how many of each of the logs files are kept. This setting also applies to the number of exception logs that summarize exceptions that occurred on any particular day.
| `disable` | Set to _true_ to stop tracing.
|===

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1beta2
kind: OpenLibertyTrace
metadata:
  name: example-trace
spec:
  podName: Specify_Pod_Name_Here
  traceSpecification: "*=info:com.ibm.ws.webcontainer*=all"
  maxFileSize: 20
  maxFiles: 5
----

Generated trace files, along with _messages.log_ files, are stored in the `serviceability` folder with a format such as `/serviceability/_namespace_/_pod_name_/_timestamp_.zip`.

Once the trace has started, it can be stopped by setting the `.spec.disable` field to `true`. Deleting the CR will also stop the tracing. Changing the `podName` will first stop the tracing on the old Pod before enabling traces on the new Pod.

You can check the status of a trace operation using the `status` field inside the CR YAML. You can also run the command `oc get oltrace -o wide` to see the status of all trace operations in the current namespace.

**Important**: _Liberty server must allow configuration dropins. The following configuration should not be set on the server: `<config updateTrigger=“disabled”/>`. Otherwise, OpenLibertyTrace operation will not work on the server._

Note:
_The operator doesn't monitor the Pods. If the Pod is restarted or deleted after the trace is enabled, then the tracing wouldn't be automatically enabled when the Pod comes back up. In that case, the status of the trace operation may not correctly report whether the trace is enabled or not._
